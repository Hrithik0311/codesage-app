        question: "In Road Runner, what is the purpose of Feedforward gains like `kV` and `kA`?",
        options: [
          "To correct for errors after they have occurred.",
          "To proactively predict the motor power needed for a given velocity and acceleration.",
          "To limit the robot's maximum speed.",
          "To define the physical size of the robot."
        ],
        correctAnswer: "To proactively predict the motor power needed for a given velocity and acceleration.",
        explanation: "Feedforward is proactive, using a model of the robot to predict required power, which makes the system much more responsive than a purely reactive PID controller."
      },
      {
        question: "You need your robot to drive very slowly while passing under a bridge, but quickly across the rest of the field. What is the best way to achieve this?",
        options: [
          "Lower the max speed for the entire OpMode.",
          "Apply custom `TrajectoryVelocityConstraint` and `TrajectoryAccelerationConstraint` to that specific path segment.",
          "Use `sleep()` commands to slow it down.",
          "Manually control the motor power."
        ],
        correctAnswer: "Apply custom `TrajectoryVelocityConstraint` and `TrajectoryAccelerationConstraint` to that specific path segment.",
        explanation: "Constraints allow for fine-grained, segment-by-segment control of your path's motion profile, which is the ideal way to handle this."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the key difference between `drive.followTrajectorySequence()` and `drive.followTrajectorySequenceAsync()`?",
        options: [
          "The `Async` version is less accurate.",
          "The `Async` version is non-blocking, allowing other code to run in parallel.",
          "The `Async` version does not require tuning.",
          "The regular version is for TeleOp, `Async` is for Auto."
        ],
        correctAnswer: "The `Async` version is non-blocking, allowing other code to run in parallel.",
        explanation: "Asynchronous following is critical for advanced autonomous routines where mechanisms must operate at the same time as the drivetrain."

      {
        question: "Your robot's odometry shows it is at X=50, but after detecting an AprilTag, you calculate its true position is X=55. What is this discrepancy called and how do you fix it in Road Runner?",
        options: [
          "It's called a bug; you must restart the OpMode.",
          "It's called lag; you fix it by calling `drive.update()` more often.",
          "It's called a constraint violation; you fix it by increasing `MAX_VEL`.",
          "It's called odometry drift; you fix it with `drive.setPoseEstimate()`."
        ],
        correctAnswer: "It's called odometry drift; you fix it with `drive.setPoseEstimate()`.",
        explanation: "Odometry drift is the inevitable accumulation of small errors. Using an absolute reference like an AprilTag and calling `setPoseEstimate()` is the standard way to correct it."

      {
        question: "In the Command-Based programming paradigm, what is the primary role of a `Command`?",
        options: [
          "To define a specific, self-contained action with a clear end condition.",
          "To hold the `DcMotor` and `Servo` objects.",
          "To manage the main OpMode loop.",
          "To store hardware configuration names."
        ],
        correctAnswer: "To define a specific, self-contained action with a clear end condition.",
        explanation: "A Command encapsulates a single goal, like 'GoToLiftPosition'. It uses Subsystems to achieve this goal and tells the Scheduler when it's finished."

        question: "Which feedforward term specifically counteracts the force of gravity on a vertical lift?",
        options: [
            "`kS` (Static Gain)",
            "`kG` (Gravity Gain)",
            "`kV` (Velocity Gain)",
            "`kA` (Acceleration Gain)"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "`kG` (Gravity Gain)",
        explanation: "`kG` provides a constant power output to perfectly balance the force of gravity, making the mechanism behave as if it were on a horizontal plane."

          question: "When following a trajectory asynchronously, your main autonomous loop should continue as long as `opModeIsActive()` is true AND what other condition is true?",

              "`drive.trajectoryCompleted()`"
          ],
          correctAnswer: "`drive.isBusy()`",
          explanation: "`drive.isBusy()` returns true while Road Runner is actively following a trajectory, making it the perfect condition for your main autonomous loop."

      {
          question: "In Command-Based architecture, what is the advantage of decoupling `Subsystems` from `Commands`?",
          options: [
              "It improves reusability; the same Command can be triggered by a button in TeleOp or run in an autonomous sequence.",
              "It makes the code run faster.",
              "It's the only way to use the IMU.",
              "It uses less battery power."
          ],
          correctAnswer: "It improves reusability; the same Command can be triggered by a button in TeleOp or run in an autonomous sequence.",
          explanation: "Decoupling allows you to write the logic for an action once (in a Command) and then use it in multiple contexts, which is a core principle of good software design."

      {
          question: "Why can't you just rely on odometry for a full 30-second autonomous without any correction?",
          options: [
              "The odometry wheels will break.",
              "Small, incremental errors from wheel slip will accumulate into a large position error.",
              "The rules forbid it.",
              "The IMU will overheat."
          ],
          correctAnswer: "Small, incremental errors from wheel slip will accumulate into a large position error.",
          explanation: "No physical system is perfect. Odometry drift is unavoidable, and using an absolute reference like AprilTags is the best way to ensure field-long accuracy."

      {
          question: "If you want to run your intake motor while your robot is driving a 5-second trajectory, what is the best approach?",
          options: [
              "Drive the trajectory, then run the intake for 5 seconds.",
              "Create a single trajectory that has the intake command embedded in it.",
              "It is not possible to do both at once.",
              "Use `followTrajectorySequenceAsync()` and control the intake from within the main `while(drive.isBusy())` loop."
          ],
          correctAnswer: "Use `followTrajectorySequenceAsync()` and control the intake from within the main `while(drive.isBusy())` loop.",
          explanation: "This is the classic use case for asynchronous control. Starting the trajectory asynchronously allows your main loop to be free to run other logic, like controlling an intake motor, in parallel."
