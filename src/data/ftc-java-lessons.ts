        options: ['To analyze code for errors.', 'To provide advanced motion planning for smooth, complex paths.', 'To control servos.', 'To manage team collaboration.'],
        correctAnswer: 'To provide advanced motion planning for smooth, complex paths.',
        explanation: 'Road Runner is a specialized library for generating and following complex trajectories, which is a step beyond simple state-based autonomous routines.'

        question: 'What is "odometry" in the context of FTC?',
        options: ['A way to measure distance with a sensor.', 'Using special, unpowered wheels to track the robot\'s precise X and Y position.', 'The robot\'s orientation from the IMU.', 'A type of drivetrain.'],
        correctAnswer: 'Using special, unpowered wheels to track the robot\'s precise X and Y position.',
        explanation: 'Odometry wheels are not connected to motors. They are free-spinning wheels with encoders that are used purely for measurement, providing a much more accurate position estimate than motor encoders alone.'

        question: 'Is Road Runner a simple, drop-in replacement for a state machine?',
        options: ['Yes, it works automatically.', 'No, it is a complex library that requires significant setup and tuning.', 'It only works in TeleOp.', 'It is an older, outdated technology.'],
        correctAnswer: 'No, it is a complex library that requires significant setup and tuning.',
        explanation: 'While incredibly powerful, Road Runner is an advanced tool that requires a solid understanding of robotics concepts and a willingness to follow a detailed tuning process.'
